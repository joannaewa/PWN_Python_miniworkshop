# PWN_Python_miniworkshop

On 13th of November 2019 I attended a workshop organized by PWN called: 
"„Zrób swoją pierwszą aplikację do analizy danych w Pythonie”
("Create your first application for analyzing data in Python").

Participiants were given a file with data (dane.txt) and during workshop we solved some problems and performed calculations together.

At home I independently found a solution for additional tasks and I won a prize for doing this correctly and as one of the first three persons.

Project was created with Python 3.8
